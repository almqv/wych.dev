Many among us hold the conviction that the world is the plaything of an elite few - the apex of the pyramid, the one percent of the one percent. These puppeteers are seen as deities, manipulating the strings of existence without solicitation. Yet, the world's fabric is woven with more than black and white threads. It is a complex tapestry, filled with myriad players each maneuvering in the grand chessboard of geopolitics.

Indeed, the perception that our world is so dichotomous is a masterstroke by these chess players. They seek to lull the masses into a comforting illusion of predestination, that the hand they were dealt at birth is the only one they will ever hold, and that the future cards dealt is out of their control, its stack of cards controlled by someone or something else. Yet, the proficient poker player is not proficient by luck and does not win by mere luck.

The one percent of the top one percent understand how to navigate the currents of probabilities, with almost prescient-like manipulation of causalities, and lead themselves onto a path designed to bring them closer to their end goal.

The common narrative tells us that it is our politicians who are the catalysts of change, particularly in the realms of climate and social progression. This is nothing more than a carefully crafted illusion.

Real transformation is not born from the rhetoric of politicians or the cries of social movements. These are but mechanisms engineered by the chess players, devices to garner trust and amass power, or perhaps to sow the seeds of distrust, tilting the scales in favor of another creation of their schemes.

In this intricate dance, it's a game of feints and parries, of concealing your true objectives. In many cases, there might not even be any designs behind most current events, but rather butterfly effects of the massive geopolitical organism which is the summation of the entire system. It is only then that we must care for it with utmost caution, as it is the hand of chaos and entropy causing those events. We must then flow with it and make that organism converge with our plans through careful manipulation of probabilities. And even in some cases, design such events.

Our political landscape is a battleground riddled with cunning designs and propaganda, instruments employed not for good or evil, but to beguile us into lending our support to those who promise mere cosmetic changes to the law, while the heart of the matter remains untouched.

Beware the illusions woven by the politicians. They engage in an antiquated game of power. We, the builders and founders, are the true bearers of control. We are an indomitable tide, for we are the fabric of the world, not the politicians who bicker beneath the gaze of the public's eye.

Our world is a multi-dimensional chessboard, where every piece, be it pawn or queen, bishop or knight, possesses its own agency, its own allegiance, while still operating within the greater framework yet still outside of it.

Yet, each piece's abilities are not set in stone. They evolve, shifting under the influence of its own actions and those of other players on the board.

Those who excel at this game, the "one percent of the one percent", are those who exploit and abuse the system to the greatest extent. They may be the grand-masters of our world, but do not be deceived. They do not command absolute control. There is no concept of veto. **And there are no "sides".**

Every player, be they minor or major, has their own gambits. The borders drawn on maps are merely another tool in the arsenal, a means to manipulate populations through the fervor of nationalism. Even if the outcome appears detrimental to them, it may very well be the culmination of their intricate plotting.

A chess game can be seen as a chaotic system, similar to those in fluid dynamics or gas systems. In this view, the directional movement vector of a group of pieces is influenced by all others on the board. The end result, the cumulative effect from the start of the game, can't be predicted due to its chaotic nature. However, the probabilities within the system can be manipulated to approximate the desired state over time.

These are the fine threads that founders must adjust to ensure the ***Golden Path***.
