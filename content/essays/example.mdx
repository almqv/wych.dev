Everything is written by me, and everything here is my own opinion, philosophical beliefs, or just random thoughts that have no real-world application. They are not intended to be taken at face value, as they are nothing but a medium for me to personally reflect on my own thoughts as a therapeutic exercise, or just for fun.

These essays are meant to be read as a collection of my own personal thoughts and reflections on the world, and are not intended to be taken as a comprehensive guide to anything. They are also not intended to be taken as a comprehensive guide to my own beliefs, as I am constantly evolving and my beliefs are always changing.

I do not claim to have all the answers, and I am not trying to preach to you. I am just trying to share my own thoughts and reflections on the world, and hopefully spark some interesting conversations.

Thanks,

Elias
